# Skillbox Course Analytics

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze course performance and student progress to help Skillbox course creators and editors improve the content and management of courses. By examining various course metrics, this analysis aims to evaluate instructor workload, assess content quality, and investigate seasonal variations. The insights from this analysis will inform decisions about Skillbox course updates, workload distribution, and content revisions, contributing to an enhanced learning experience for students.

### Methods Used
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Descriptive Statistics
* Seasonal Trend Analysis

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Project Description
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on various datasets related to course offerings, student progress, and course content. The analysis focuses on understanding course performance, student engagement, instructor workload, and the quality of course modules. The data includes student demographics, course details, and lesson progress, which are used to derive key insights.

Key areas of focus include:
1. Forming analytical descriptions for each course based on calculated metrics.
2. Evaluating the potential instructor workload to determine if additional hires are necessary.
3. Investigating course content quality to identify problematic modules requiring revision.
4. Analyzing the presence of seasonal variations in student progress and engagement.

## Project Needs
- Data exploration and descriptive statistics
- Workload analysis
- Course quality assessment
- Data visualization
- Reporting and recommendations

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help, see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. The `progress_phases.csv` dataset was too large to upload to the repository, but it can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uejxyeuFtVLNOZtl_3W85o9U2xdpKogM/view?usp=sharing).
3. The primary Jupyter notebook for the project is kept [here](https://github.com/vladvintenbakh/SkillboxAnalytics/blob/main/Skillbox_Course_Analytics.ipynb).
4. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and run the notebook.
